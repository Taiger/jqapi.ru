# jQuery 1.8 API Cheatsheet

Single page jQuery API Cheatseet by [Future Colors].

Forked to preserve version 1.8 because, lets face it, this the best jquery cheatsheet that ever was!
(At this time of writing.. Drupal 7 is upgradable to version 1.8 and not beyond :()


Original repo is powering http://jqapi.ru site.



## Goals

* all methods and attributes on one page
